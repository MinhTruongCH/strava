# strava
End-to-end data pipeline for cycling and running activity analytics using Strava API, Azure Databricks, and Power BI. This project automates the extraction of personal activity data from Strava, cleans and transforms it in Databricks with PySpark, and aggregates it for visualization in interactive Power BI dashboards.
